How to install? (And possible problems)
=================================================

Because the script uses `openssl dgst -sha1 -mac HMAC` and the `-mac HMAC` was introduced in 1.0.0 series.

Check your openssl version first by using `openssl version` command. If you are on Linux, your `openssl` should be newer than `1.0.0`. Just install by typing these:

1. `make`
2. `sudo make install`

In case that your system isn't shipped with a compatible version of `openssl`, you might need to update `openssl` manually by compiling the source code. 

On Mac OS X which comes with `0.9.8zg` that doesn't recognize required parameters as I've mentioned in issue #2 please update openssl with homebrew.
